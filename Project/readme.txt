Functionalities: The player controls a plane using arrow keys to move and mouse clicks to adjust speed while avoiding obstacles and collecting rewards. Initially, the plane’s health is set to 100 HP at the start of the game. The goal is to survive, score points, and complete adventure levels before health runs out. Here’s how health decreases:
• Obstacle hits: Obstacles appear in the plane’s path and must be avoided to prevent damage. Colliding with them reduces the plane’s health. Each collision costs 10 HP. However, it checks if the plane is in Power Mode and reduces health by only 5 HP in that case.
• Rain: While rain is active, health drains by 0.1 HP per frame (≈ 3 HP/second at ~30 FPS).
• Health reaching 0 ends the game.

Collectibles: Collectibles increase the player’s score when picked up, helping to achieve a higher total. It ppear along the flight path and increase the player’s score when collected. The more collectibles gathered, the higher the final score.
Adventure Level: There will be two Adventure Level.
• Obstacle Run: Obstacle Run Level is the main adventure mode where the plane continuously moves forward, and the player navigates through a field of obstacles, avoiding collisions while collecting items to score points and survive as long as possible
• Rapid Reward: Rapid Rewards is a special adventure mode where the plane speeds up, and the player collects a large number of items appearing along the path to quickly increase their score while obstacles are temporarily cleared. The special feature of Rapid Rewards is the increased plane speed and abundant collectibles, allowing the player to earn points rapidly without worrying about obstacles.

Mode: There will be two mode.
• Power Mode: Power Mode allows the player to shoot weapons from the plane, destroying obstacles in the path. Each shot slightly reduces the plane’s health, 1 HP for every 20 shots, so it must be used strategically.
• Ghost Mode: As rain damage the plane, Ghost Mode makes the plane invulnerable to rain, preventing the health from decreasing by the usual 0.1 HP per frame during rain. This allows the player to focus on collecting items and avoiding obstacles without worrying about rain damage.

First Person Perspective: First-person perspective mode is a camera view that places the player's viewpoint directly inside the cockpit, giving them the illusion of seeing the sky through the pilot's eyes. This mode provides an immersive experience by hiding the player's plane and changing the camera's position to a point slightly in front of the cockpit.
Third Person Perspective: The game features a third-person perspective, with the camera positioned behind and above the plane, allowing the player to see the plane, obstacles, and collectibles while navigating through the environment.
